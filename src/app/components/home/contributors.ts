    name: 'Martin Smolka',
    bio: `Martin is a Senior at The University Of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he is finishing up his bachelor’s in computer science. Martin has experience with building modern web applications and works as an undergraduate researcher on Dr. Papadopoulou's team to build and maintain DecoBubbles. When building DecoBubbles, Martin had the challenge of converting the proven MatLab based bubble counting GUI to the web to allow for crowdsourcing. He designed and developed DecoBubbles using Google’s Angular Framework and developed the structure of the database in Firebase.`,
